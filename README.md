# Trading Journal

## Foreword
>> synonym of Trading Log

This is the spreadsheet I use personally to keep track of my trades. You are welcome to use it and moreover contribute to it. Afterall, I'm not a spreadsheet PRO at all so there are a couple of functionalities I would love to see/add in this file but lack the knowledge to do so in spreadsheets.

I know a little bit of python and tried to implement them using macros but failed miserably. Macro integration is not as straight forward as it may seem...

Honestly feel free to contribute or at least suggest features I might not have thought off. You can always reach me at [codeartha@gmail.com](mailto:codeartha@gmail.com).

## Getting started

Coming soon

## Note:
If you intend on using this spreadsheet use the latest one tagged in the "release" section. The repository state may be work-in-progress and thus contain testing data as well as bugs.

## Pricing

It is **completely free** to use. 

Multiple companies sell Trading Journals/Logs solutions. Sometimes as a pay once and enjoy, but most try to squeeze a monthly subscription out of you. I don't feel it's worth it so **DON'T!**

I never bought any of these because they seem like a waste of money.
None of them have a feature that I desperately need and could not implement myself. Afterall a trading log can be quite basic and still plenty useful. Some functionalities would be convienient to have but not vital. As such I can't justify spending any money on it and I would suggest you do the same.

That's why I made this one free to use!

However, I did spend quite a few hours creating it at first and then maintaining, adding new features and such take some time. 
Furthermore I hope someday to find enough time to create a separate program, probably in python or javascript because like I said, there are some features I have no idea how to implement in a spreadsheet even though they would be easy to implement otherwise.

So if you like this Trading Journal feel free to donate (any amount) to help me improve it and some day make a separate program out of it:

 // no donate links yet, maybe one day if I feel like setting it up
